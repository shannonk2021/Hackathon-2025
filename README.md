The Tropical Trojans Present: ScholarSearch!
Presented by Nicholas Carew, Shannon Kuykendall, and Christopher Lloyd

Students all over the world face the same difficulties: College is expensive, and internships are competetive and hard to find.

Our website, ScholarSearch, helps you cut out the tedious work of finding and tracking down specific scholarships and internships that you are intested in and qualify for. We use GeminiAI to do the research for you, and filter the many oppurtunities that are out there to your specific qualifications and interests.

We use the Google Gemini 2.5 Flash API to directly integrate GeminiAI into the website to curate the scholarships and internships to you. We coded the website in both JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to ensure an optimum user experience.

We faced a multitude of challenges while working on this project. First, we found that websites now have a bot protection service that stops Gemini from directly looking at the website, and so this resulted in the occasional internship or scholarship application being blank, not existing, or out of date.
We also were challenged with learning how to directly integrate the Gemini API system into the website. We also found that working on a project of this magnitude in such a short time constraint was difficult, but we are happy with the final product.

For the future, we would like to work on adding two new tabs: a career searching tab to find long term jobs after college, and a college searching tab to help students find a college that matches their interests and major. In doing this, we would create a guided college experience to help jumpstart your career.

A simple solution for what should be simple process. Made for students, by students.
